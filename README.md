# ML Hackathon: Binary Classification Project

This project was developed for the BACT-X0PA Machine Learning Hackathon associated with the National University of Singapore. We placed 3rd out of 60+ participants. The goal was to predict which job applicants got hired, based on a real-world dataset of job descriptions and applicants' CVs.

## Key Features

- Designed preprocessing pipelines with:
  - Target encoding of categorical variables
  - Synthetic feature generation
  - Data scaling and imputation
- Evaluated multiple models including logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost.

## Tools & Libraries

- Python, scikit-learn, pandas
- Jupyter Notebooks
- matplotlib / seaborn for visualization

## Results

- Top 3 finalist
- Presented to a panel of Data Scientists
- Recognized for clean feature engineering, clarity of model explanations, and reproducibility
